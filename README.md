# KA-TRANSPOSE
A 3D-printed HackRF case for transportation in a go-bag. 

### Purpose
This case should provide:
- Some minor shock protection when in a backpack/laptop bag
- A customizable way to make your HackRF yours

### Ideally
I'd like to have a few things for this, so this case should be treated as a work-in-progress
for now. 

Note: I'm still VERY newbish at 3D modeling, and I haven't quite come up with a way to
give that customization method in any easy form outside of modifying the models themselves.

Models will be released after I'm confident I've squashed ~~all~~ most glaring bugs



## Design notes

I used blender with a billion boolean modifiers. It seemed to be the easiest way to handle this.
The skeletonization of the case is to do two things: 
- Reduce print time
- Reduce print material cost

However, I noticed an unintended benefit of the case in this way; at the cost of time and material,
I can add customization in a way that's entirely optional through modeled faceplates.

This brings the overall cost down unless you decide to print the full faceplate, and the other
benefits, too!
